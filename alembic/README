Generic single-database configuration.

Integrated with api.models, so as new models or updates to existing models are made, we can automatically
migrate the changes to the database.

Run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "some revision message"`, then check the generated migration file 
in versions/ folder and make sure the changes are as expected. Some manual changes may be needed.
